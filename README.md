# NEURAL
Neural Networks and Matrices in C++

- TODO - Use Eigen to do backpropagation and implement the modular system in Eigen.

# NOTES

- The neural networks here are implemented in both naive C++ and the Eigen C++ library. This is to provide both high-performance implementations and implementations that are easy to read and understand the math behind (without having to translate to linear algebra and back).
